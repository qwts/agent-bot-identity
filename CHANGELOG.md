# Changelog

## Unreleased

`owner` is the account an App is installed on, not the roster's governance
owner (#194).

- The runtime profile no longer requires `owner` to equal
  `profile.accountOwner`. A private App can only be installed on the account
  that owns it, so an organization the governance owner controls gets its own
  App, installed on the organization while the person keeps governing the
  roster; that configuration now loads without `profile-invalid` and without
  falsifying either field. A config whose `owner` differs from the projected
  account owner is not a projection and is never overwritten by a profile
  republish.
- `mint-token` mints against an App's only installation whatever `owner`
  says; `owner` is consulted only when an App is installed on several
  accounts. The multi-installation errors name the candidate accounts and
  distinguish "`owner` matched none of the installations" from "pick one".
- `owner`, when present, must be a non-empty account name.

## 0.4.0

The macOS account, not the directory, is bot territory (ENG-0339 supersedes
ENG-0045; #187).

- Identity resolution gains the account as the fallback below the pin: in a
  rostered agent account (`<prefix>-<harness>-agent`, or an `apps` override)
  every checkout — primary or linked — resolves to that harness's App, and
  the `gh` shim, `worktree-token`, `mint-token`, `setup-worktree`, and
  `signed-commit` all reach it. `AGENT_BOT_ACCOUNT` names the account for JS
  and shell alike.
- In the owner's account, unpinned work is the human's delegate: commits,
  pushes, and `gh` run as the human with no refusal. The `pre-commit` and
  `pre-push` territory guards and the shim's "outside bot territory" refusal
  are gone; `pre-commit` still requires a resolvable Agent ID for
  bot-attributed commits, and `AGENT_BOT_UNMANAGED_AUTHORS` (ENG-0128) is
  unchanged.
- `--app`, `GH_AGENT_APP`, and the pin outrank the account and the directory
  and never throw on a directory mismatch; the `.<tool>/worktrees` and
  scratchpad path rules are retired.
- Shell hooks and the Claude `WorktreeCreate` gate classify the account by
  exact roster slug through `worktree-token --account-slug`, not a name glob.
- `bootstrap` reports `bot-identity-unresolved` (was
  `linked-worktree-required`); `doctor` verifies a primary checkout that
  resolves a bot identity instead of skipping it.
