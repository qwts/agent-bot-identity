# Changelog

## 0.4.0

The macOS account, not the directory, is bot territory (ENG-0339 supersedes
ENG-0045; #187).

- Identity resolution gains the account as the fallback below the pin: in a
  rostered agent account (`<prefix>-<harness>-agent`, or an `apps` override)
  every checkout — primary or linked — resolves to that harness's App, and
  the `gh` shim, `worktree-token`, `mint-token`, `setup-worktree`, and
  `signed-commit` all reach it. `AGENT_BOT_ACCOUNT` names the account for JS
  and shell alike.
- In the owner's account, unpinned work is the human's delegate: commits,
  pushes, and `gh` run as the human with no refusal. The `pre-commit` and
  `pre-push` territory guards and the shim's "outside bot territory" refusal
  are gone; `pre-commit` still requires a resolvable Agent ID for
  bot-attributed commits, and `AGENT_BOT_UNMANAGED_AUTHORS` (ENG-0128) is
  unchanged.
- `--app`, `GH_AGENT_APP`, and the pin outrank the account and the directory
  and never throw on a directory mismatch; the `.<tool>/worktrees` and
  scratchpad path rules are retired.
- Shell hooks and the Claude `WorktreeCreate` gate classify the account by
  exact roster slug through `worktree-token --account-slug`, not a name glob.
- `bootstrap` reports `bot-identity-unresolved` (was
  `linked-worktree-required`); `doctor` verifies a primary checkout that
  resolves a bot identity instead of skipping it.
